*Pinned below are some of my key projects. Thank you for visiting!*


### Featured Projects

**1. Comparative Analysis of Causal Inference Methods**
   * A deep dive into program evaluation using the Lalonde dataset. This project moves beyond standard OLS to implement and compare Logit, focused on a Differences-in-Differences estimation, used Panel Data, Fixed Effects, processed the error terms and analyzed the error's properties, pointed out strengths and weaknesses of the analysis and data.
