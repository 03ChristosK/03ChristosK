# Christos Kandylas

A final-year Honors student in Economic Theory & Econometrics at the University of Cyprus with a passion for quantitative research, econometrics, and machine learning. My long-term goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in a computational field to work on challenging, data-driven problems.

### What I'm Currently Working On

* Beginning my honors thesis focused on economics and advanced quantitative inference methods.
* Deepening my practical skills through the **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** specializations by Stanford University & DeepLearning.AI.
* Preparing for a Master's degree in Data Science / Statistics at top European universities.

### Core Skills

* **Languages:** Python, STATA
* **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
* **Methodologies:** Econometric Modeling, Causal Inference, Time-Series Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization

*Pinned below are some of my key projects. Thank you for visiting!*


### Featured Projects

**1. Comparative Analysis of Causal Inference Methods**
   * A deep dive into program evaluation using the Lalonde dataset. This project moves beyond standard OLS to implement and compare Logit, Propensity Score Matching (PSM), and Instrumental Variable (IV) models to address selection bias.
   * **[➡️ View Project Repository](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repository-Name)** ```

**Why this works perfectly:**

* **It's Impressive at a Glance:** A professor or recruiter can read this two-line summary on your main page and immediately understand the project's sophistication.
* **It's Clean and Organized:** It keeps your main profile from getting cluttered with the details of one specific project.
* **It Provides a Clear Call to Action:** The "View Project Repository" link tells an interested person exactly where to go for the deep dive (where they will find your code, report, and the detailed `README.md` for that specific project).

This structure is the professional standard and the most effective way to showcase your excellent work.
